# [](#header-3)Scriptural Examples of Fatherhood.

As soon as I knew that I was going to be a father, I began seeking guidance and counsel from others concerning good fathering. It seemed that there were endless sources of varying opinions on everything ranging from how to get babies on a good sleep schedule (and making sure to take an equal share in the work!) to stimulating their physical and mental development. Countless ‘baby hacks’ videos and Google articles later, I found that I’d accumulated some good worldly knowledge concerning how to physically care for my son. 

While caring for the physical needs of children is a vital and important duty for fathers, I’d argue that too many fathers (myself and other Christians included) do too little to focus on the spiritual development of our children. Of all the resources I found online, not one of them mentioned caring for the spiritual welfare of our children! I decided to undertake to discover valuable lessons to be learned from the scriptures that exemplify spiritual care of children. Here are just a few examples of the many righteous fathers in the scriptures and their spiritual examples.

# [](#header-4)The Father of the Prodigal Son – Luke 15:11-32 

I don’t know if I’ve seen a more compassionate and forgiving example of fatherhood than the father of the prodigal son. Jesus famously told the story of when the son of a rich man took his inheritance early and left him only to squander the small fortune he gained “with riotous living.” (Luke 15:13) The prodigal son soon fell on hard times and was living an impoverished lifestyle when he decided to go back to become a servant in his father’s house. It appears that his father was keeping an eye out for him, because the scripture says, “that when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him” (Luke 15:20).

The prodigal son’s father then restored him to full fellowship in his house, and even had a feast to celebrate his return. This timeless tale of love and forgiveness truly exemplifies unconditional love, which is why I determined it to be the first great example of parenthood from the scriptures. 

# [](#header-4)Joseph – Matthew 1:16-25
A discussion of Christ-like fathers would not be complete without considering the example of the Savior’s earthly father Joseph. Rather than being indignant and seeking punishment for Mary when he found that she was “with child,” he was “not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily…” (Matthew 1:19). He was described as a “just man,” and was worthy of receiving a vision from the Lord where he was told to “fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins” (Matthew 1:19-20). We all know that he acted in faith and trusted in God’s word, taking Mary to be his wife and provided both home and care for the boy Jesus as he grew into the Savior that we now look to as the source of all mankind’s salvation.
Jesus Christ – The New Testament and Book of Mormon

The Savior Himself, though no canonical record explicitly states he had children, is the paramount example of fatherhood. I have come to know Him as the Father of my Eternal Salvation and consider Him to be exactly the same in characteristics to our Heavenly Father. I love Him, and hope that my son can come to love and look to Christ as a pattern for his behavior and the source of his salvation.

# [](#header-4)Lehi – 1 Nephi

The first thing that the prophet Nephi mentions in the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, is the goodly nature of his parents. He mentions being “taught somewhat in all the learning of my father” (1 Nephi 1:1). We know his father as Lehi the prophet who had a vision in which the Lord commanded him to depart from his comfortable home in Jerusalem, which had fallen to wickedness. He faithfully obeyed and gave sacrifices to the Lord at nearly every step of their journey. Of Lehi’s example it was said: 

"A father is a teacher. The Lord has commanded sons and daughters to honor their parents and to give heed to their counsel. The words that open that great volume of scripture, the Book of Mormon, ought to be our guide as fathers: “… having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father.”  (1 Ne. 1:1)" (1973 October General Conference A. Theodore Tuttle, The Role of Fathers - https://www.lds.org/study/general-conference/1973/10/the-role-of-fathers?lang=eng)

Truly Lehi was an exemplary father.

# [](#header-4)Alma the Younger – Mosiah 27; Alma 36-42

Alma the younger is a Book of Mormon Prophet who exemplifies personal change and development as well as inspiring change in his children. As a young man, he lived like the prodigal son and did not follow in righteous paths, “seeking to destroy the church of God…” (Alma 36:6). He ultimately had a life-changing experience when an angel appeared to him, and through the fasting, prayers, and faith of his father (also named Alma), experienced a life-changing conversion. He dedicated the rest of his life to serving the Lord and bringing others to the faith. 

At least three of his sons, Helaman, Corianton, and Shiblon accompanied him in his service to a group of apostates known as the Zoramites. We know from an account of his teachings that he lovingly helped Corianton overcome some personal problems and gave great encouragement to Helaman and Shiblon in their righteous efforts. He taught them all his knowledge of Jesus Christ and God’s great plan for mankind and showed them an example of faithful obedience. A full account of his words to his sons can be found in chapters 36-42 of Alma in the Book of Mormon. Ultimately, Alma the younger has shown me what it takes to 1) overcome my personal struggles and 2) be an exemplary father when it comes to teaching and helping my children along the path of life. 

In all, there are countless examples of Christian fathers in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and throughout history. Making a serious study of them and comparing their successes, failures, teachings, and examples can ultimately lead us to learn how to become better fathers. Hopefully, doing so will lead to better lives for our children and instill in them a faith in God and a desire for righteousness.
