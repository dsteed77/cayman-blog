### A Study of Christ-Centered Fatherhood - and to Share Christ, and Share Fatherhood

I’m grateful for the opportunity to have made Christ-centered fatherhood the focal point of my studies for my Book of Mormon class this fall semester. In order to make my studies more meaningful I used the pattern given by Brother Jepson in class. He taught us to: 
1. Ask inspired questions
2. Identify quotes from General Authorities
3. Share insights with others
4. Record lessons learned during the study

Following this pattern deepened my conversion and strengthened my understanding of what fatherhood is really about, which is why I made this blog!
 
### The Blog

In order to internalize my studies and enhance my learning, I decided that my wife and I would generate a series of blog posts centered on lessons I learned either through experiences or studies around fatherhood. From writing about examples of fatherhood in the scriptures to tips about improving family scripture study, I took on a joint undertaking with my wife to generate quality posts to internalize and share our insights. 

I will say that I hit a lot of roadblocks in getting the site up initially. I’m not an accomplished web developer by any means, and I wanted to host my website for free through GitHub Pages (Hence the URL – [http://www.dsteed77.github.io](http://www.dsteed77.github.io)). I also wanted something that looked good, was easy enough to maintain, and would allow me full flexibility to customize the front-end (the look of the web page). I decided to use Jekyll, a great static site generator that doesn’t require a database like many other web applications these days. 

Due to some technical difficulties, I was about to give up on Jekyll and GitHub pages altogether. I then prayed and told God that I was trying to do a good thing and asked for his help. Soon after I felt his guiding hand point me to correct resources to solve my problem. After hours of work, I found that I had simply neglected to change the base URL in the configuration file, which prohibited my site from rendering properly in a live environment. I’m grateful that I stuck through to the end because now I have a simple but attractive site that my wife and I can share our learning through.

Ultimately, my technical experiences were not the highlight of the project, as the website is simply a vehicle for the rich learning that has taken place over the last 3 months. I will now describe what I came to know, understand, believe, and change about my approach to parenthood and God’s eternal plan. 

## Know

I began this semester with the knowledge that soon I would become a father. I also knew that I am a son to both my earthly father and Heavenly Father and came to know of a great many examples of fatherhood in the scriptures. I learned that Lehi tried to encourage rebellious Laman and Lemuel to faithfulness by naming a river and valley in their honor (1 Nephi 2:8-11). In the scriptures I read that Nephi recorded prophecies of Christ “…that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins” (2 Nephi 25:26). It seems evident that over the centuries, prophets handed down holy records from father to son, and that righteousness and peace prevailed in each generation that effectively taught their children the truth. 

I’m grateful for the examples of Alma the Elder, Alma the Younger, and of King Mosiah—all who became great leaders, teachers, and steadfast followers of Christ. Many extoll their efforts on the grand scale, highlighting their prophetic callings as their paramount achievement. However, as I’ve come to study their examples, I know that their greatest influence was on their children. They were great fathers and were genuinely concerned for the welfare of their children. This steadfast dedication and commitment was evident in their teachings, but it taken a deeper study to truly understand why their actions were just so impactful.

## Understand

As I came to know the exemplary fathers of the scriptures, I delved deeper into understanding the purpose of their fatherly actions by studying the words of modern prophets and other General Authorities of the church. From them I gained an understanding that “a father is a teacher. The Lord has commanded sons and daughters to honor their parents and to give heed to their counsel.”  I also gained an understanding that if my children do wander that there is hope, and that I ought to “pray for [my]… children; hold on to them with [my] faith. Hope on, trust on, till [I] see the salvation of God”  The prophet of my youth, President Gordon B. Hinkley helped me to understand that fatherhood and teaching others is not only a nice gesture, it’s an absolute imperative! He said:  

>“Each of us is responsible for the welfare and the growth and development of others. We do not live only unto ourselves. If we are to magnify our callings, we cannot live only unto ourselves.”  

These and countless other quotations from prophets have taught me much about my role as a father. I have come to understand that being called a father is more than a simple title, but that it’s a life-changing role that carries with it much responsibility. I’ve also come to understand through experience (now that I am a father) that fatherhood is no easy endeavor. It takes all of the attributes of Christ—faith, hope, charity, patience, humility, diligence, virtue, obedience, and knowledge—to truly become a Christlike father. I also understand that I have a long way to go but believe that I have the capacity to improve over time because of the remarkable gift of the Savior’s atoning power. 

## Believe

My belief in Jesus Christ has strongly influenced my approach to fatherhood. I’ve come to believe strongly in and appreciate the role of fathers so much more after this study of Christ-centered fatherhood. My understanding of fatherhood has changed my belief so that now I feel that it is necessary of every man to become a father in order to become the best person they can possibly be. Obviously, every man’s journey is different, and for some fatherhood doesn’t appear to be possible in this lifetime. I do know that eventually every male needs to participate in this divine role in order to progress in the eternities. This newly-found and deep-seated belief has strongly influenced the way I feel toward fathers and has spurred a great desire for change in my personal life. 

## Change

This has been a semester of great change in my life. The arrival of our firstborn son was a miraculous and life-altering experience for both of us, and I feel grateful that much positive change has resulted from it. I personally have had to change many of my habits to align myself with both Heavenly Father’s will and the needs of my family. I’m in the process of learning to prioritize my time and have worked hard to eliminate distracting media from my life. It hasn’t been easy, but I’ve implemented methods to help me to better “put away childish things” (1 Cor 13:11). I feel that fatherhood and my study of the Book of Mormon has “awaken[ed me] to a sense of [my] duty to God, that [I] may walk blameless before him, that ye may walk after the holy order of God, after which [I] have been received” (Alma 7:22).

In all, I have come to recognize the power of Christ-centered fatherhood through my study of the Book of Mormon. I hope that my website enables and motivates my wife and I to share and keeping our understanding of divine parenting, and that others will benefit as well. I’m grateful for my son, Tanner. I love him so very much and hope that I can be the father that he needs to grow, develop, and learn. I know that the Book of Mormon is a true testament of Jesus Christ, who is the father of our eternal salvation.
