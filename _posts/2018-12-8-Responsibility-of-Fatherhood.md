## Why should Fatherhood be a Priority? 

Defining fatherhood - After studying the Book of Mormon and focusing on Christ-Centered Fatherhood, I've come to realize several very important things:

### 1. Our greatest contribution to society will be our influence on the children we bring into this world.

I realize that I personally have no authority to say what people should and shouldn't do with their lives, but that's not my objective here. My goal is to share my belief that fathers have a greater potential to impact the rising generation of boys than any other demographic. My personal experience is that I have my own father to thank for much of my spiritual, physical, and social development. 

According to [*The Family: A Proclamation To the World*](https://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation?lang=eng&old=true) "By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families." In this case it's clear that God requires fathers to be leaders in our household. Not the worldy type of leader that seeks dominion over others, but the type of leader that brings the best of each member forward.

Through his provision of the necessities for a childs life, a father secures for himself greater confidence, prosperity, and joy. As is said in [D&C 75:28](https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/75.28?&lang=eng#28) "Every man who is obliged to provide for his own family, let him provide, and he shall in nowise lose his crown; and let him labor in the church." This extends the duty of fathers beyond our own family into developing others as well. 

Fatherhood should not be a role that is not mutually exclusive, and isn't meant to be a role that reduces our capacity to help others but rather strengthens it! I have been very blessed by countless men who I called leaders in my church. We experienced many camping trips, youth activites, and spiritual experiences that have all blessed and shaped me into the person I am. 


>"Each of us is responsible for the welfare and the growth and development of others. We do not live only unto ourselves. If we are to magnify our callings, we cannot live only unto ourselves. As we serve with diligence, as we teach with faith and testimony, as we lift and strengthen and build convictions of righteousness in those whose lives we touch, we magnify our priesthood" - President Gordon B. Hinckley, [*Magnify Your Calling*](https://www.lds.org/study/general-conference/1989/04/magnify-your-calling?lang=eng)

### 2. Fatherhood is (and always has been) under attack.
 
Jacob, one of the great prophets of the Book of Mormon, boldly addressed infidelity and pride amongst the men of his people, saying:

>"Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children, because of your bad examples before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up to God against you. And because of the strictness of the word of God, which cometh down against you,many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds." ([Jacob 2:35](https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2?lang=eng#35))

He described the current state of their greatest enemies the Lamanitse as being "more righteous than you... [because] their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers..." [Jacob 3:7](https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3?lang=eng#7)

>"in many societies today men and boys get conflicting and demeaning signals about their roles and value in society." - Elder D. Todd Christofferson, [Brethren, We Have Work to Do](https://www.lds.org/study/general-conference/2012/10/brethren-we-have-work-to-do?lang=eng)

###  3. Families and societies suffer greatly when Fathers do not fulfill their role and responsibilities.  

As part of my study to prepare for this article, I came across a study done by [The National Fatherhood Initiative](https://www.fatherhood.org/the-father-absence-crisis-in-america?hsCtaTracking=5a07c8d1-a224-4e61-a34a-b81adaa363bc%7Cd4d59e71-64bd-4916-a37b-f8d2740c9ef7) that presented some startling statistics that represent just how important fathers may be in the lives of their children. The data indicated that children with absentee fathers (biological, step, or adoptive) are more likely to live in poverty, have behavioral problems, and drop out of high school to name a few. This correlation shows an association with fathers in the home and positive social outcomes. The data that they used was from the 2017 US Census, and while I'm sure what other contributing factors are in the mix ([causation vs correlation](https://www.iperceptions.com/blog/causation-vs-correlation)), it appears that fathers have a major impact on outcomes for their children. Here are the insights that they presented:
