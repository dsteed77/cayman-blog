## Why should Fatherhood be a Priority? 

Defining fatherhood - After studying the Book of Mormon and focusing on Christ-Centered Fatherhood, I've come to realize several very important things:

### 1. Our greatest contribution to society will be the children we bring into this world.

I realize that I personally have no authority to say what people should and shouldn't do with their lives, but that's not my objective here. My goal is to share my belief that fathers have a greater potential to impact the rising generation of boys than any other group or individual.  in my life that I have to thank for much of my spiritual, physical, and social development. 

>"Each of us is responsible for the welfare and the growth and development of others. We do not live only unto ourselves. If we are to magnify our callings, we cannot live only unto ourselves. As we serve with diligence, as we teach with faith and testimony, as we lift and strengthen and build convictions of righteousness in those whose lives we touch, we magnify our priesthood" - President Gordon B. Hinckley, [*Magnify Your Calling*](https://www.lds.org/study/general-conference/1989/04/magnify-your-calling?lang=eng)

### 2. Fatherhood is (and always has been) under attack.
 

Sometimes women don't allow men to be the leaders that they need to be. 
>"in many societies today men and boys get conflicting and demeaning signals about their roles and value in society." - Elder D. Todd Christofferson, [Brethren, We Have Work to Do](https://www.lds.org/study/general-conference/2012/10/brethren-we-have-work-to-do?lang=eng)

###  3. Families and societies suffer greatly when Fathers do not fulfill their role and responsibilities.  

As part of my study to prepare for this article, I came across a study done by [The National Fatherhood Initiative](https://www.fatherhood.org/the-father-absence-crisis-in-america?hsCtaTracking=5a07c8d1-a224-4e61-a34a-b81adaa363bc%7Cd4d59e71-64bd-4916-a37b-f8d2740c9ef7) that presented some startling statistics that represent just how important fathers may be in the lives of their children. The data indicated that children with absentee fathers (biological, step, or adoptive) are more likely to live in poverty, have behavioral problems, and drop out of high school to name a few. This correlation shows an association with fathers in the home and positive social outcomes. The data that they used was from the 2017 US Census, and while I'm sure what other contributing factors are in the mix ([causation vs correlation](https://www.iperceptions.com/blog/causation-vs-correlation)), it appears that fathers have a major impact on outcomes for their children. Here are the insights that they presented:
