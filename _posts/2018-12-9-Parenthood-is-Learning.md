## Parenthood should be spelled learning. 

### *Learning from our children*

As a first time parent there are innumerable lessons to be learned. The list of “firsts” is long and the list of “have done this before” is short leaving lots of room for some great life lessons. The joys that accompany becoming a parent are unparalleled as it truly is one of life’s greatest journeys. I am grateful that I get to experience parenthood with a supportive spouse and that this beautiful complex journey is something we get to take on together. With all of these lesson to be learned it seems that experience becomes the great teacher but have you ever considered the fact that we have many, yes I repeat many lessons to learn from our children. Many great and important lessons can be lost on us if we erroneously believe that as parents we are the only teachers. This is simply not the case. These precious souls have much to teach us about life and living. Not so sure? Consider some wise council offered by Jean A. Stevens in her talk entitled Become as a Little Child. 

>"... Children...provid[e] examples of some of the childlike qualities we need to develop or rediscover in ourselves in order to enter into the kingdom of heaven. They are bright spirits who are untarnished by the world—teachable and full of faith. It is no wonder the Savior has a special love and appreciation for little children. Among the transcendent events of the Savior’s visit to the Americas, His tender ministry to the children stands apart. In a poignant way, He reached out to each child. 

>'And he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them. And when he had done this he wept. … And he spake unto the multitude, and said unto them: Behold your little ones'  (3 Nephi 17:21–23)"

What does it mean to behold them? To behold them means to be in awe of their goodness and their divine potential. There are countless lessons we can learn for these intelligent little spirits but we have to be humble so that these eternal lessons are not lost on us. Many great lessons can be learned as I look to my baby child's purity and excellence. It's amazing to consider the love that my spouse and I feel towards this child as we behold him as the Savior has instructed. We can best prepare for parenthood by humbling ourselves and submitting to the will of the father, always heeding his counsel and following his ways if we want to succeed.

### Learning from Heavenly Father
 
When a precious child enters the world we have a choice as parents to decide that we will raise this precious soul on our own or to decide that we will need to ask God for his direction. These precious little miracles are entrusted to us as earthly parents but we must never loose site of the fact that they are Heavenly Fathers spirit child with Divine potential. That’s were humility steps in. It’s in these moments of our own parental infancy when we get to decide if we are going to try out this whole parenting gig on our own trusting in our own knowledge or whether we will as the proverbs state, “not lean into our own understanding”. Parenthood is one of the greatest measures of trust. For instance, a loving God entrusts these special spirits to us hear on earth. It is up to us to decide how much we will trust his direction. Prayer becomes a parents greatest lifeline. I remember once a friend telling me that her mother always says, “When I prayed,I was taught”. God is willing to teach us how to be better parents if we will but ask. So the next time you are weighed down and don’t know what to do turn to God. He has the answers.
