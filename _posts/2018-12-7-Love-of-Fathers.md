I saw this video today on [lds.org](https://www.lds.org/media-library/video/topics/fathers?lang=eng) and it made me tear up a little (yes, dads can [and should](https://www.babble.com/parenting/hey-dads-real-men-can-and-should-cry/) cry!). It made me think of just how much love I possess for my son Tanner and for the love that I hope he will share with me. 

At the risk of this being a sappy tribute to my dad, I'd just like to mention the 3 most important lessons that I've learned from him:

### 1. Express your Love by serving others
There are many stories that remind me of this powerful lesson that my dad taught me in my youth. 

#### Ministering

In my church, youth are paired up with adults to 'minister' to other families. Some members see this as an obligatory friendship or requirement to visit at the end of each month and present a sub-par lesson to their assigned families. My dad and I were 'assigned' (I like to think of it more in terms of divinely appointed) two immigrant families to minister to because of my dads ability to speak Spanish. 

My dad went beyond an obligatory monthly visit to these wonderful people. He took a sincere interest in their lives, invited them to swim and have meals at our house, and helped them in any way that he could. I remember being enlisted to go and saw down a tree in one of the family's yards on a hot summer's day. 

I also played the embarrassing role of 'Santa's little helper' as my father arranged a magical christmas visit from Santa, complete with gifts. I never realized until my adult years just how impactful this experience would be for me as I remember the kindness and generosity my father had towards these families despite our cultural differences. It was his actions that taught me this one valuable lesson﻿—That Love is the [essence of the Gospel](https://www.lds.org/study/general-conference/2014/04/love-the-essence-of-the-gospel?lang=eng) of Jesus Christ

#### Serving

Whether it was a natural disaster or just someone moving out their house, my dad was always the superman wanting to help. He was (and still is) a pretty strong person, but once he injured himself and required back surgery, he would always enlist my help. As a teenager I wasn't always appreciative of his abundantly sharing my video game time with people in need, but I am forever grateful that he magnified his fatherhood by supporting and encouraging me to serve. 

I remember one experience that was particularly impactful﻿—[The Davis County windstorm of 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_County_windstorm_of_December_2011) (Check it out it's a real thing!). On December 1st of my senior year of high school, there was a massive windstorm that affected thousands of people in and around my home city. Sheds, trampolines, pine trees, and rooftops were blown about or destroyed by a tempestuous windstorm that rocked our hometown. The community really pulled together to assess, clean up, and repair the damage that occured. 

It was during this time that my dad taught me the masterful skills of caring for and using a chainsaw, and boy did I have fun. We spent at least three days sawing, hauling, and chucking logs of all shapes and sizes to clean up our neighborhood. Like I mentioned, my dad had previously undergone a pretty significant back surgery, and had every excuse to 'let the younger guys do it,' but he was out there working just as hard (if not harder) than everyone else. I love my dad for his example of service.

### 2. Always run the extra lap

My dad was a pretty good athlete in his day. He was a collegiate wrestler, and lettered in more sports than I care to remember in high school. He always tried to help me reach my full potential as a young athlete, though I was clumsy and uncoordinated as I tried to grow into my oversized body. As I dealt with my mounting athletic frustrations over the years, he taught me a very valuable lesson﻿—to alwasy run the extra lap. 

I say the extra lap because when I was in little league football, 'the lap' was a huge circle around three baseball diamonds, a playground,and a large field at Nichols Park. In total, I think the lap must have been just under a mile. That's pretty far for a 10 year old kid! After every practice, my dad would arrive, and tell me to 'run another lap' despite the rigorous conditioning that we had just completed. I was resistent at first, incredulous that he would make me do something after being so physically taxed, but I did it anyway. 

There was one practice that my dad was very late in picking me up, and I remember being kind of mad so I resolved to run and run and run until he showed up. 6.5 laps later, he finally arrived and I ran to the car. He expressed amazement and admiration as I entered the vehicle describing my feats. He told me that he had seldom run that far and that if I kept that up, that I would be in the best shape on the team. 

Whether or not I was the best conditioned on the team (I was *not*) was not as important as the lessons I learned from my dad. I learned that hard work produces great results on and off the field. It's helped me in my education, in my personal life, and in establishing relationships with others. I will always remember this simple lesson﻿—to run the extra lap.

### 3. Believe in yourself

It's needless to say that life comes with struggles. My struggles have typically been centered around my apparent lack of self-efficacy, or my ability to be confident in what I do. My struggles with this became particularly strong in in junior high school (everyone else, of course was super confident back then). My dad (despite my best efforts to shut him out at times, which I regret deeply) was one of my most constant supporters through these trying times.

There were times when I'd be struggling that an uplifting note or book would appear in my bag or my dad would simply come and try to talk with me about what I was going through. There were several occasions when my dad would give me [priesthood blessings](https://www.lds.org/study/general-conference/1987/04/priesthood-blessings?lang=eng) and most importantly express his deep love and confidence in me. These were some of the most impactful experiences of my life and continue to give me strength through my challenges to this day. 

Ultimately, what I'm trying to say is that I love my dad. Like the children in this video, my dad taught me how to play, fish, ride a bike (a post for another time;)), and have faith in Jesus Christ. With them, I'd like to say "I love you dad!" I appreciate you more than you could know. 

*This post wasn't meant to be so long, or get so personal, but maybe that's what dadhood is all about*
