This is the personal Blog of David and Danielle Steed. Married since 2015, we are the parents of one perfect baby boy. We are a Christian family, and are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The purpose of this blog is to share uplifting messages and to help us in our personal studies about parenthood.

Special thanks to the creators of the _Cayman Blog_ Jekyll theme, an open source website theme which provided the framework for this site.
