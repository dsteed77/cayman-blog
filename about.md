This is the personal Blog of David and Danielle Steed. Married since 2015, we are the parents of one perfect baby boy. We are a Christian family, and are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The purpose of this blog is to share uplifting messages and to help us in our personal studies about parenthood.

This site makes use of videos and other media resources from [lds.org](https://www.lds.org) for personal, noncommercial use. Our opinions are in no way sponsored by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, but are founded on our personal study and interpretation of them.  

Special thanks to the creators of the _Cayman Blog_ Jekyll theme, an open source website theme which provided the framework for this site. You can find out more info about using this theme, as well as basic usage documentation, and source code at: [cayman-blog](https://github.com/lorepirri/cayman-blog)
